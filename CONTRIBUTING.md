```
const data = [
  ...,
  {
​    id: n,
​    name: "John Doe",
​    link: "https://johndoe.com",
​    tags: ["FrontEnd", "Backend"]

  },
  {
​    id: n+1,
​    name: "Your name",
​    link: "https://your-website.com",
​    tags: ["", "", ...]
  },
]
```

***Tags are not the technologies used but rather the areas in which you are***
